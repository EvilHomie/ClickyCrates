The Game (Simple Clicker)
<br />
# Description
A simple clicker in which you need to "explode" arising objects on the screen.
<br />
# How to play
-First, choose a difficulty level. It depends on the intervals of the appearance of objects on the screen.<br />
Easy - 1 item per second.<br />
Normal - 2 items per second.<br />
Hard - 3 items per second.<br />
<br />
-Then we blow up the objects by clicking the left mouse button on them and get points.<br />
